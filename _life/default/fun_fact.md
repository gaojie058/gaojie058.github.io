    <h5>Fun Facts</h5>
    <p>
      I would like to share several fun facts about me:
        <li>
            <del>I love running.</del> No, I lied. I really think running is the most boring activity. I love <b>walking in nature</b>, even <b>watching TV at home, swimming, playing squash, and hiking</b> are much more interesting than running.
        </li>
        <li>
            <del>I hate writing.</del> No, I lied. I've <b>kept a diary from high school until today (over 10 years)</b>. Actually, I used to write everything down in middle school too, but that notebook was lost. I was so sad that I couldn't find it. I write these experiences to help me remember what I was thinking as a child, a teenager, and a young adult. And I'm very happy to say that nothing has really changed since I was 13 years old, except that I'm more mature now.
        </li>

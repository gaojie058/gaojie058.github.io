  Machine learning (ML) enabled systems are emerging with recent breakthroughs in ML. A model-centric view is widely taken by the literature to focus only on the analysis of ML models. However, only a small body of work takes a system view that looks at how ML components work with the system and how they affect software engineering for ML-enabled systems. In this paper, we adopt this system view, and conduct a case study on Rasa 3.0, an industrial dialogue system that has been widely adopted by various companies around the world. Our goal is to characterize the complexity of such a large-scale ML-enabled system and to understand the impact of the complexity on testing. Our study reveals practical implications for software engineering for ML-enabled systems.

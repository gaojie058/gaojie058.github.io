  People face lots of challenges when working from home (WFH). In this paper, we used both LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) topic modeling and qualitative analysis to analyse WFH related posts on Weibo (N=1093) and Twitter (N=907) during COVID-19. We highlighted unique differences of WFH challenges between two platforms, including long work time, family and food commitment and health concerns on Weibo; casual wearing habits on Twitter. We then provided possible guidelines from a cross-cultural perspective on how to improve the WFH experience based on these differences.

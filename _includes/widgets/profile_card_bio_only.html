                                I am currently a Malone Postdoc Fellow in <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://malonecenter.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Malone Center for Engineering in Healthcare</a> and <a href="https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/">Center for Language and Speech Processing</a> at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins University</a>. I am mentored by <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/" target="_blank">Mark Dredze</a>, <a href="https://www.ziangxiao.com/" target="_blank">Ziang Xiao</a>, and <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~cmhuang/" target="_blank">Chien-Ming Huang</a>. My research interests include <b>Human-AI Collaboration, AI for Social Science, and Human Aspects of Software Engineering</b>. As a <b style="color: #d2691e;">human-AI collaboration researcher</b>, I focus on empowering humans for analysing complex data.

                                <b style="color: #d2691e;">Research Interests: </b>Every major technological leap has transformed how humans analyse and learn from data, a process shapes how we make business decisions, formulate public policies, and even diagnose diseases. Today, AI made us enter the next chapter where humans and AI can jointly learn from data. I leverage AI techniques and social science methodologies to design, build, and evaluate human-AI collaborative systems that empower humans to analyze complex unstructured data. <b>My long-term vision is to expand human capabilities through human-AI collaboration, moving beyond data analysis toward broader human cognition.</b>
